                <h2>Amur Leopard</h2>
                <p>
                    People usually think of leopards in the savannas of Africa but in the Russian Far East, a rare
                    subspecies has adapted to life in the temperate forests that make up the northern-most part of the
                    species’ range. Similar to other leopards, the Amur leopard can run at speeds of up to 37 miles per
                    hour. This incredible animal has been reported to leap more than 19 feet horizontally and up to 10
                    feet vertically.
                    The Amur leopard is solitary. Nimble-footed and strong, it carries and hides unfinished kills so
                    that they are not taken by other predators. It has been reported that some males stay with females
                    after mating, and may even help with rearing the young. Several males sometimes follow and fight
                    over a female. They live for 10-15 years, and in captivity up to 20 years.

                <p>
                    Amur leopards live in the Amur Heilong Landscape, which spans both the Russian Far East and adjacent
                    areas of China. This rare subspecies of leopard has adapted to life in the temperate forests that
                    make up the northernmost part of the species’ range

                    In an amazing tale of recovery related to concerted conservation efforts, the number of Amur
                    leopards in Russia has increased from 27-32 to 70-75 in the last 15 years, while China has recorded
                    an increase of 13-15 individuals in bordering provinces
