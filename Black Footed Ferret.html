                <h2>Black Footed Ferret</h2>
                <p>
                    Once thought to be globally extinct, black-footed ferrets are making a comeback. For the last thirty
                    years, concerted efforts from many state and federal agencies, zoos, Native American tribes,
                    conservation organizations and private landowners have given black-footed ferrets a second chance
                    for survival.
                    Today, recovery efforts have helped restore the black-footed ferret population to nearly 300 animals
                    across North America. Although great strides have been made to recover the black-footed ferret,
                    habitat loss and disease remain key threats to this highly endangered species..

                <p>
                    e long, slender animals, enabling them to easily move through prairie dog burrows. They weigh
                    between 1.5 and 2.5 pounds and can grow up to 24 inches long. A strip of dark fur across their eyes
                    gives them the appearance of wearing a mask

                <summary>How long does a black footed ferret live ?</summary>
                <p>
                    about 4 years
                    Males are more active than females: males tend to travel about double the distance that females do.
                    Few black-footed ferrets live beyond 3-4 years of age in the wild. They typically live to be about 4
                    years old in human care
