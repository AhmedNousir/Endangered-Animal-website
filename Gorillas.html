                <h2>Gorillas</h2>
                <p>Gorillas are fascinating creatures that share 98.3% of their DNA with humans!
                    did you know they can laugh? There are two species, the Eastern Gorilla and the Western
                    Gorilla, and they both have two subspecies. Three out of four are Critically Endangered on
                    the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. The only one that isn’t is the Mountain Gorilla,
                    a subspecies of the Eastern Gorilla, which is considered Endangered. At the time of writing
                    (June 2020), there are only around 150 to 180 adult Cross River Gorillas left in the wild. Like many
                    endangered animals, their decline is mostly due to poaching, habitat loss, disease, and human
                    conflict.
                    Gorillas are also slow to recover as they have a low reproductive rate, meaning females only give
                    birth every four
                    to six years. One female will breed three or four times in her lifetime.</p>

                <summary>Facts About the Gorilla</summary>
                <p>
                    African apes (gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos) diverged from a common ancestor about 5 million
                    years ago and belong to the family Hominidae.<br>
                    Gorillas are one of our closest living relatives, after chimpanzees and bonobos. They share between
                    95% and 99% of our DNA!<br>
                    Gorillas and chimpanzees walk quadrupedally (on all fours) and use their knuckles to carry the
                    weight of their head and torso.<br>
                    Gorillas have been observed displaying emotions such as grief and compassion for other primates,
                    including humans.<br>
                    Scientist have shown that gorillas display individual personalities.<br>
                    Gorilla family groups each live within relatively small areas of land. Different groups can however
                    occupy converging areas and co-exist peacefully.<br>
                    Gorillas will groom each other by combing each other with their fingers and teeth. This ‘social
                    grooming’ is an important aspect of gorilla groups which helps to establish and reinforce social
                    bonds.
