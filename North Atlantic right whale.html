                <h2>North Atlantic right whale</h2>
                <p>
                    They are gentle giants that stay close to coasts and spend a lot of time at the surface skim feeding
                    on zooplankton,
                    all of which makes them an easy target and the ‘right whale to hunt’.
                    They were almost wiped out by hunters after their meat and oil-rich fat known as blubber,
                    and are now one of the most endangered large whales. There are currently only around 400 of them
                    left,
                    and only about 100 breeding females. They are now protected, and hunting is illegal, but population
                    recovery is slow.
                    Females don’t breed for the first ten years of their life and then will give birth to a single calf
                    every six to ten years.
                    They are still very much at risk of extinction, with boat strikes and entanglement in fishing gear
                    some of the biggest threats.
                    Vessel traffic also creates noise that interferes with their ability to communicate.

                <p>
                    North Atlantic right whales grow up to 52 feet (15.8 m)long and weigh up to 140,000 pounds (63.5
                    metric tons).<br>
                    North Atlantic right whales can live up to 70 years. <br>
                    Researchers use their ear wax to determine their age after they have died
