                <h2>Sea Turtles</h2>
                <p>
                    Two species of sea turtle are critically endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species:
                    Hawksbill Turtles and Kemps Ridley Turtles. Leatherback sea turtles are classified as Vulnerable,
                    though the population is decreasing and several subpopulations are facing extinction.
                    Hunting is one of the biggest threats to sea turtles, with poachers targeting their eggs, shells,
                    meat and skin.
                    They are also at risk from habitat loss, bycatch, and pollution as well as climate change.
                    Sand temperature determines the sex of hatchlings with eggs developing as females in warmer
                    temperatures.
                    That means even small temperature changes could skew the sex ratio of populations.
                    Furthermore, breeding beaches could disappear underwater with sea-level rise.

                <summary>Facts About the Hawksbill Sea Turtle</summary>
                <p>
                    The Hawksbill Turtle is one of the smallest species of turtle.<br>
                    It is characterized by a narrow, pointed beak and a beautiful patterned shell, and it inhabits the
                    warm,
                    tropical coastline waters of the world’s oceans – from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific and Indian
                    Ocean as well.<br>
                    It’s difficult to know precisely how many Hawksbill Turtles exist because but research suggests
                    that there are only 5 populations world-wide,
                    made up of around 8,000 turtles in total, and with only 1,000 females nesting annually.<br>
                    Turtles leave the sea to lay their eggs on the beach.
                    They will choose a spot, dig a hole, lay their eggs, cover them up and return to the sea leaving
                    their eggs behind.
                    The eggs will remain buried for around 60 days until they hatch<br>
                    The trade of this turtle shell is illegal in an effort to conserve the population.<br>
                    Despite this, the Hawksbill Turtle shell is still found in souvenirs and jewelry.<br>
                    In fact, it’s the most frequently confiscated illegal item by custom officials.<br>
                    Their beautiful gold and brown patterned shells, also known as “tortoiseshell”,
                    are hunted and sold illegally on the black market. They are used to create ornamental
                    products and valuable jewelry.<br>
                    Sea turtles have been swimming in the oceans for much longer than humans have been on
                    the planet earth.<br>
                    These reptiles have existed for the last 100 million years.
                    Sadly, this beautiful creature is the most endangered species of turtle and is the
                    4th most endangered species on our top 10 list.<br>
