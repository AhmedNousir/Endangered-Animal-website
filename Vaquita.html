                <h2>Vaquita</h2>
                <p>
                    The vaquita is both the smallest and the most endangered marine mammal in the world.
                    It has been classified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN since 1996, and in 2018, there were only
                    around 6 to 22 vaquitas left.
                    The latest estimate, from July 2019, suggests there are currently only 9.
                    Their biggest threat is from the illegal fishing of totoaba, a large fish in demand because of its
                    swim bladder.
                    Vaquitas accidentally end up entangled in the gillnets set for totoaba and drown because they can no
                    longer swim to the surface to breathe.
                    Conservation efforts led to the introduction of a ban on gillnets in vaquita habitat back in July
                    2016,
                    but illegal fishing continues, and the threat remains. Efforts now focus on enforcing the ban on
                    gillnets and persecuting those that use them.

                <summary>Facts About the Vaquita</summary>
                <p>
                    The Vaquita, also known as ‘cochito’, ‘vaquita marina’ and ‘Gulf of California harbour porpoise’,
                    exists in only one place in the world, the Gulf of California.<br>
                    This narrow body of water is nestled between the second longest peninsula in the world, Baja
                    California
                    (translated from Spanish meaning ‘below’ or ‘south’ California) and the north west coast of mainland
                    Mexico
                    They are the rarest sea mammal in existence.<br>
                    Vaquitas are likened to porpoises and often confused with dolphins, but they are smaller, have a
                    chunkier body and have a rounded head with no snout.<br>
                    lDolphins, whales and vaquitas are all in the same family known as cetaceans,
                    which are large sea mammals characterised by their appearance, intelligence and carnivorous (meat
                    eating) diets.<br>

                <p>
                    They also need to come to the surface to breathe.<br>
                    Unlike dolphins that will follow boats, vaquitas are shy, private creatures and as such very little
                    is known about them.<br>
                    In fact, these little sea creatures were not discovered until as late as 1958 when three vaquita
                    skulls were discovered on a beach.<br>
                    Vaquitas can communicate with each other and navigate using sonar
                    Sadly, the vaquita is classified as critically endangered with less than 100 thought to survive
                    The fishing industry, pollution and habitat destruction from the dam built in the Colorado River
                    threaten its survival.<br>
                    Illegal fishing for an exotic fish, the totoaba is the biggest threat to the Vaquita. The gillnets
                    used frequently entangle and drown vaquitas.
